## Objective

Ship reviewer-facing dashboard/task UX and enforce WCAG-oriented baseline checks with automated guardrails.

## Scope Delivered

1. Operations workspace with queue filtering, task detail, progress panel, checker panel, and explicit/implicit feedback flows.
2. Accessibility-focused UI hardening:
   - Skip link to main content
   - Tab semantics for workspace switcher
   - Focus-visible ring styles
   - Minimum touch target sizing (`min-h-11`)
   - Explicit `aria-label` coverage on core controls
   - Live region feedback announcements
3. Automated accessibility guardrail tests:
   - `tests/ui/test_accessibility_static.py`
4. Operations end-to-end API flow test:
   - `tests/api/test_operations_flow.py`

## Verification

- `npm run build` (frontend) passes.
- `uv run pytest tests/ui/test_accessibility_static.py tests/api/test_operations_flow.py tests/api/test_review.py tests/api/test_status.py` passes.

## Constraints / Follow-up

- Live browser-runtime audit with axe/playwright is blocked in this environment due network restrictions that prevent downloading Playwright browser binaries.
- Static accessibility guardrails are now enforced in CI as an immediate quality gate.
