# Rookie Website Design Brief

**Project**: Marketing website for Rookie (AI employee platform for CPA firms) **Owner**: You're looking at them **Deadline**: TBD, but don't fuck around

---

## The Vibe

**Anti-AI-hype.** Every AI company website looks the same: gradient backgrounds, abstract blob animations, buzzwords like "revolutionizing" and "transforming."

We're not doing that.

Rookie's whole thing is treating AI like a new employee — not a miracle, not a threat, just a junior hire who needs supervision and earns trust over time. The website should feel like that: **competent, unpretentious, quietly confident.**

Think: the accounting firm that wears jeans on Fridays but still files perfect returns.

## Brand Personality

| **Attribute** | **What it means**              | **What it's NOT**        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Competent** | We know our shit. No hedging.  | Arrogant, dismissive     |
| **Grounded**  | Realistic about AI limitations | Overpromising, hype-y    |
| **Human**     | Warm, occasionally funny       | Robotic, corporate-speak |
| **Direct**    | Say things plainly             | Jargon-heavy, evasive    |
| **Modern**    | Contemporary, not dated        | Trendy for trend's sake  |

**Voice examples:**

- ✅ "Rookie prepares returns. You review them. That's it."
- ✅ "The junior accountant who never calls in sick."
- ❌ "Leveraging cutting-edge AI to transform your firm's efficiency"
- ❌ "Powered by advanced machine learning algorithms"

---

## Target Audience

**Primary**: CPA firm owners/partners (40-60, stressed, skeptical of tech promises) **Secondary**: Firm managers evaluating tools, accounting industry investors

These people have been burned by software that overpromised. They're tired. They want something that just *works* without a 6-month implementation and $50K consulting engagement.

**Mental state when arriving**: "What's the catch?"

## Site Structure

### Homepage

- Hero: One sentence value prop + one visual (not an abstract gradient blob)
- Problem statement (talent shortage, burnout, etc.)
- Solution framing (AI as employee, not magic)
- Social proof / credibility (when available)
- CTA: Waitlist or demo request

### How It Works

- Simple walkthrough: Assign → Prepare → Review → Learn
- Show actual artifacts (Drake worksheet example, preparer notes)
- Trust model explanation (the "first 10 returns" progression)

### Features (or "What Rookie Does")

- Personal Tax Agent
- Business Tax Agent
- Bookkeeping Agent
- Checker capability
- Each with concrete deliverables, not abstract benefits

### Pricing

- Placeholder for now, but design the section
- Comparison framing: cost vs. junior hire

### About / Company

- Minimal for now
- Philosophy statement
- No fake team photos of stock image people

### Blog / Resources (future)

- Design the template, content comes later

## Visual Direction

### Color Palette

**Primary**: Deep navy or charcoal (trust, professionalism) **Accent**: Something warm but not aggressive — maybe a muted coral, amber, or sage **Neutrals**: Off-white, light gray

Avoid: Bright blues (too "tech"), gradients (too "AI startup"), pure black on pure white (too stark)

### Typography

- **Headlines**: Something with personality but readable. Not a geometric sans-serif that every SaaS uses. Maybe a slightly rounded sans or a modern serif.
- **Body**: Clean, highly readable. Priority is legibility, not style.
- **Accents**: Consider a monospace for data/numbers (fits the accounting context)

### Imagery

**Do:**

- Real photography where possible (not generated)
- Actual spreadsheets, actual documents (anonymized)
- Clean mockups of interfaces
- Subtle illustrations if needed (line-art style, not cutesy)

**Don't:**

- Stock photos of diverse people high-fiving
- Abstract AI brain/network visualizations
- Robots
- Gradients that look like sick tropical fish

### Motion

- Minimal. Subtle entrances, smooth scrolls.
- No hero animations that take 4 seconds to load
- If showing workflow, use a simple step-through, not a video explainer

---

## Technical Requirements

- Responsive (obviously)
- Fast as hell (accounting people are impatient)
- SEO-ready structure
- Contact/waitlist form with email integration
- Analytics ready (GA4 or Plausible)
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)

### Stack Preference

Whatever you're fastest in. No preference between Webflow, Framer, Next.js + Tailwind, etc. Just make it performant and maintainable.

---

## Copy Tone Guidelines

**General:**

- Active voice, short sentences
- Second person ("you assign work", not "firms can assign")
- Concrete specifics over abstract benefits
- Okay to be a little funny, but never forced

**Headlines:**

- Punchy, not clever-for-clever's-sake
- Example: "An employee that actually reads the documents"
- Not: "Redefining the future of accounting automation"

**CTAs:**

- "Get early access" > "Start your journey"
- "See it in action" > "Request a demo"
- "Talk to us" > "Schedule a consultation"

---

## Deliverables Expected

1. **Mood board / visual direction** (before diving into full design)
2. **Homepage design** (desktop + mobile)
3. **One interior page template** (How It Works or Features)
4. **Component library** (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
5. **Full site build**
6. **Handoff documentation** (how to update, add pages, etc.)

---

## What Success Looks Like

A CPA firm partner lands on the site, and within 5 seconds thinks: "Huh, this actually looks like it was made by people who understand accounting."

Not: "Oh great, another AI tool from 25-year-olds who've never filed a tax return."

---

## Reference Sites (vibe, not copy)

- **Linear** (clean, professional, slightly opinionated)
- **Basecamp** (unpretentious, clear value prop)
- **Mercury** (modern finance without the flash)
- **Notion** (information-dense but scannable)

Avoid the aesthetic of: Every Y Combinator AI startup from 2023-2024

---

## Final Note

This isn't a "move fast and break things" project. Accounting people hate broken things. Build it right. Take the time.

But also don't disappear for 3 weeks and come back with a 47-page strategy deck. Show work early, iterate fast.

Questions? Probably not — just start, show me something, we'll adjust.

*Now go make something that doesn't look like it was generated by AI. The irony would be too much.*
