# Rookie

**The junior accountant who never calls in sick.**

---

## The Problem

Every tax season, CPA firms face the same impossible math:

- Too much work
- Not enough staff
- Junior hires need 2-3 years before they're truly productive
- Good people leave for industry jobs paying 30% more
- The work that remains is repetitive, time-consuming, and exhausting

You've tried offshore prep. You've tried temps. You've tried automation tools that promise the world and deliver PDF chaos.

None of it solves the core problem: **you need more hands doing actual accounting work.**

## The Solution

Rookie is an AI employee. Not an assistant. Not a chatbot. An employee.

It prepares tax returns. Categorizes transactions. Reconciles accounts. Produces work products that look exactly like what your junior staff would produce — because it follows the same processes they do.

The difference? Rookie works nights. Weekends. Holidays. It doesn't need PTO. It doesn't job-hop after you've invested two years training it. And it costs a fraction of a full-time salary.

## How It Works

**Rookie operates like any new hire:**

1. **You assign work** through your existing workflow (TaxDome)
2. **Rookie prepares** the return using source documents and client history
3. **You review** the work product — a clean worksheet ready for Drake entry
4. **You provide feedback** — corrections become learning opportunities
5. **Rookie improves** — fewer errors, less review time, more trust

The first 10 returns? You'll check every line. That's expected. By return 50, you're spot-checking. By return 200, you're only looking at the flags Rookie raises.

That's not a promise. That's how training works.

## What Rookie Prepares

| Work Type | What You Get |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Individual Returns** | Complete 1040 worksheet with source references, ready for Drake entry |
| **Business Returns** | 1120/1120-S/1065 worksheets, K-1 schedules, basis tracking |
| **Bookkeeping** | Categorized transactions, reconciliation reports, month-end checklists |
| **Review Support** | Pre-checked workpapers with variance analysis and flagged items |

Every deliverable includes preparer notes: what data was used, what assumptions were made, what needs your attention. Just like you'd expect from a thorough associate.

## The Trust Model

We're not asking you to blindly trust AI with client work. That would be insane.

**Rookie earns trust the same way any employee does:**

- Starts with simple returns (standard W-2 situations)
- Every piece of work is reviewed
- Mistakes are corrected and learned from
- Complexity increases only after accuracy is proven
- You remain professionally liable — Rookie prepares, you sign

This isn't about replacing your judgment. It's about freeing your time for the work that actually requires it.

## The Economics

**Traditional junior hire:**
- $55-70K salary + benefits + overhead
- 2-3 years to full productivity
- 20-30% annual turnover risk
- Limited to 40-50 hours/week (realistically)

**Rookie:**
- Fraction of junior salary cost
- Productive from day one (with supervision)
- Zero turnover risk
- Available 24/7/365

The ROI math isn't complicated. If Rookie handles the prep work on 200 returns at even 50% efficiency, you've freed up hundreds of hours for higher-value work.

And unlike that junior hire who leaves for a controller job in 18 months? Rookie's still here next season, remembering every client, every preference, every lesson learned.

## What Makes This Different

**This isn't another "AI-powered" tool.**

Most accounting AI falls into two categories:

1. **Chatbots** that answer questions but don't do work
2. **Automation tools** that handle one narrow task

Rookie is neither. It's a complete workflow participant that:

- Reads source documents (W-2s, 1099s, K-1s, bank statements)
- Understands client history and preferences
- Follows your firm's specific procedures
- Produces professional work products
- Learns from your corrections

The output isn't "suggestions" or "drafts." It's actual prep work, ready for review.

---

## Client Knowledge That Compounds

Every client interaction builds institutional memory:

- Filing patterns and preferences
- Income sources and deduction history
- Red flags and special situations
- Planning opportunities identified
- Communication preferences

This knowledge lives in structured profiles that persist year over year. When Rookie starts a return, it already knows the client — their rental properties, their side business, their tendency to forget 1099s until April 10th.

Your firm's collective knowledge stops walking out the door when employees leave.

---

## Security & Compliance

- Client data stays within your systems
- Full audit trail of all AI actions
- No client PII stored in AI training
- Human approval required for all final outputs
- SOC 2 compliance roadmap in place

You're trusting Rookie with sensitive data. We take that seriously.

## The Roadmap

**Now:** Architecture complete, building core platform

**Q2 2026:** Personal tax preparation (1040s)

**Q3 2026:** Business tax preparation (1120/1065)

**Q4 2026:** Bookkeeping automation

**2027:** Expanded integrations, multi-firm deployment

We're building this right, not fast. Accounting errors aren't just bugs — they're malpractice risk. Every feature ships when it's ready, not when the calendar says so.

---

## Why "Rookie"?

Because we're not pretending AI is a senior accountant.

Rookie is exactly what the name suggests: a new hire that's eager to learn, expects supervision, and earns responsibility over time. It's a realistic framing that sets appropriate expectations.

Your clients don't need to know their return was prepped by AI. They just need to know their CPA reviewed and approved it — which you did, because Rookie prepared everything for your review.

**For Investors:**  
The accounting talent shortage isn't going away. Firms are desperate for solutions that actually work. Rookie is positioned to be the first AI that delivers real productivity gains — not promises, not demos, but actual completed work.
